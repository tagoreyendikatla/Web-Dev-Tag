                <h2>My Journey in IITB</h2>
                <h3>First Semester</h3>
                <p>My First semester was smooth and tension-free. There were two core courses of my parent department <b>CSE, CS101, CS105</b>. And there was one common course for all new batch students, <b>MA 105</b> which is maths. There are two <b>HASMED</b>(History, Arts, Sociology, Management, Entrepreneurship, Design) courses also, one is Management and Entrepreneurship. Every student will get any two HASMED courses according to their preferences. Well, actually they are very boring subjects. And there is <b>NCC</b>. I was selected to it.</p><br><br>
                <p>Well, <b>CS101</b> is about coding, it is first time i was introduced to coding. We were taught c++ language. Our professor was Manoj sir. Well he was somewhat fast in teaching, so we were struggling somewhat, watching vedios on youtube and practicing so manu questions. I scored well but there was some difficulty in lab exams, do not know whether the problem was with online or questios difficulty (may be tension).</p><br><br>
                <p><b>CS105</b>, this was the most difficult subject in first semester, it was all about logic, that's why it was difficult but well we can do if we practice a little bit more. I scored above average or average in every exam. There was a platform called <b><a href="https://piazza.com/" target="_blank">PIAZZO</a></b> where students were asking doubts and mentor and instructor replies and we were submitting some assignments also there. At the end, it also went smoothly.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>MA105</b>, for me it is easiest subject no matter how much diffcult it is because it is my favourite subject, so it becomes easy for me. In this course, of course I performed so well. But sad part is the quizzes were so easy that everyone can perform well, then interested and well practiced students cannot get the high position as they deserve, this was only problem with this course. At the end this couse also went so smooth.</p><br><br>
                <p>Now if we talk about <b>ENT101</b> and <b>SOM 101</b>, one is entrepreneurship and another management. Entrepreneurship was somewhat interesting because instructor's teaching style was so attention grabbing, Anu madam. But sad part was, I felt like i performed well but some students performed better than me. But it went smooth. Now if we talk about management, boring course in first semester. But interesting part was I performed so well except one exam, that one exam reduced my grades. In both of these courses we should submitt a project with presentation and a vedio. Advantage was, it had to be done in groups. I also contirbuted very well in both the projects. At the end both courses well very smoothly.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>PH 117</b> was a physicys lab, every week there used to be one lab. On total there are 8 experiments in the lab, everyweek we should go perform one experiment. After completing all the experiments there will a be lab exam where they will give us one experiment ramdomly, we should perform it and write samll exam on that experiment. This course was nice except the first experiment because I was new to campus at that time.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>NCC</b> was difficult(physically), but it was good. I gained some leadership qualities and discipline(This was there with me even before joining NCC). There were mostly drill classes and few theory classes where they teach us about Army(Respect). Drill sessions were so physically straining ones. Best part was after every drill sessions they distribute some refreshments(snacks). And this course went so smooth(Isn't it?)</p>

                <h3>Second Semester</h3>
                <p>My Second semester was a little bit stressed. There was a core course <b>CS104</b> from my own department CSE. There was <b>MA110</b> which is maths again, there was a course <b>BB101</b> which biology which I do not like at all. There was extra course called <b>MS101</b> which is a combination of Mechanics and Electrical Engineering, and <b>NCC</b> was there, and this is the last semester I had <b>NCC</b> (if not failed, but I passes).</p><br><br>
                <p>My core course was <b>CS104</b>, which was little disturbing, the course was easy but not quizzes and lab exams. I understood all concepts very well but I struggles somewhat in exams and quizzes. It is all about <b>SSL</b>. There was a platform called <b><a href="https://www.vlab.co.in/" target="_blank">CLAB</a></b> where we used ot weekly assignments, that platform provides us unix experience, because all the concepts which were taught were taught accordign to unix command lines. Some students rebooted their pc's but I didn't. I though of doing it later.</p><br><br>
                <p>Then comes <b>MA110</b>, which is maths, this is more difficult than first semester but you know it is easy for me(Know right!). Concepts were little confusing but constant practice and revision amde it easier and understable. Again the same problem, the exams were easy so that every student performed well and deserving students didn't get upper hand. At the end the course went too smooth and clean.</p><br><br>
                <p>Here comes <b>BB101</b>, this was all about biology, I can say I am not at all interested in biology, but the good thing was, here also the instructor was so good at teacher and grabbing attention, she taught well. But the worst part was the correction rules by the instructor are nothing less than bad. So many students lost marks due to strict rules. Even I lost the deserving marks. But again the course went too smooth(I should say by the end I got interest).</p><br><br>
                <p>Then comes, <b>MS101</b>, the most exciting and interesting course, it includes both Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Every week, there used to be two classes one for each stream of Engineering and two labs for each stream of Engineering till midsem, after midsem the timetable changed that classes will not be there only labs, and in the labs now we have to work on drone, we have to prepare a real life drone, so interesting, isn't it? And that should be done in group of 6 memebers, here I can say that I was not the one with high contribution but we did it good. The sad part was, at the time of flying test, our drone didn't fly well, we lost 2 marks because of it, it doesn't affect much but affects. At the end again, the course went soo smooth and exciting.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>CH 117</b> is a chemistry course, this is same like PH 117, it is lab course, we should go to chemistry lab every week once and perform once experiment, on total there are 7 experiments. This time I enjoyed a lot, tell me who wouldn't enjoy chemistry experiment which we used to just imagine in our young age in schools, so this was amazing course and best part was I performed all experiments well. There was a exam at the end and experiment was ramdomly given, I performed well and this course also went too smooth.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>NCC</b> was difficult(physically), but it was good. I gained some leadership qualities and discipline(This was there with me even before joining NCC). There were mostly drill classes and few theory classes where they teach us about Army(Respect). Drill sessions were so physically straining ones. Best part was after every drill sessions they distribute some refreshments(snacks). And this course went so smooth(Isn't it?)</p>

            <h2>Memories</h2>
            <div class="memory">
                <p>The day joining in the campus will be the most memorial day not only for me but many other students. It was my dream of joining IITB, but that day was so confusing and strained, because there was so much to do, collecting keys, paying fee, sorting new room, attending oreintations.</p>
                <img src="images/firstday.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="memory">
                <img src="images/orientation.jpg">
                <p>There were so many orientations, subject related orientations, and some about regulations adn rules of the campus and some about like Gender cell.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory">
                <p>Next, the best thing was attending sessions, the first session in <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</b>. I was little bit nervous because I come from tier-2 town and well back tier-3 in childhood and sitting in a prestigious campus among tier-1(rich or modern) kids, it feels like everything is new and modern. Well even now I am feeling the same, I was not able to patch up with those modern guys, so I even made friendship with guys who has mindset like me and the guys who I know before going to campus.</p>
                <img src="images/class.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="memory">
                <img src="images/exam.jpg">
                <p>Generally they conduct exams in class rooms itself, and lab exams in labs. First experience of exam in class room was too excited and it was maths exam, I performed well. They will release seating arrangment of every student 2 days before the exam, we should carry our ID card to the exam hall and then we will be allowed to write the exam.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory">
                <p>Now if we talk about other activities, like playing, there is very big ground(probably not the biggest I have ever seen in my life) and there is gymkhana. Well I should appreciate it, every thing is very good. We used to go there and play fooball or badminton when we feel bored. And as I am NCC cadet sometimes, they also take us to the ground to make us perform drill.</p>
                <img src="images/games.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="memory">
                <img src="images/parade.jpg">
                <p>I am a NCC cadet and so I participated in <b>Republic Day Parade</b>. It is on Jan 26th but for us, the preparation for the parade started way before it. Generally, NCC session will be weekly once, but that period of time, they were daily conducting drill sessions, imagine how much hard it would be for the body but again it is good for the body anyway, we will loose laziness, we will learn discipline.</p>
